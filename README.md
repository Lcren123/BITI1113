##  B. ABSTRACT 

Chatbots are simulations which can understand human language, process it and interact back with humans while performing specific tasks. For example, a chatbot can be employed as a helpdesk executive. The first chatbot was created by Joseph Wiesenbaum in 1966, named Eliza.

## C.  MEME CHATBOT DATASET

In this project, we’ll discuss our meme chatbot, detailing how our computer vision/deep learning pipeline will be implemented.

From there, we’ll review the dataset we’ll be using to train our custom meme chatbot.

I’ll then show you how to implement a Python script to train a chatbot on our dataset using Keras and TensorFlow(subjected to change).

We’ll use this Python script to train a chatbot and review the results.

Given the trained meme chatbot, we’ll proceed to implement two more additional Python scripts used to:

- recognize text related to the meme,
- reply meme message upon requested or triggered from chat message

We’ll wrap up the post by looking at the results of applying our chatbot.


There is two-phase COVID-19 face mask detector as shown in Figure 2:

"Currently Unavailable"

Our goal is to train a custom deep learning model to be able to ultilize meme in a chat room.

How was our meme chatbot created?
The ICT course has alway been a mystery course to many people, in order to help people get the hang of it in a more fun and easy way, tons of ICT meme was created to describe
ICT while also relieve ICT worker stress by making jokes only known by them.

So, we decide to create a meme chatbot so that no matter normal people or ICT worker could have some fun talking to this bot while also learning something new.

- Best case scenario — we could use this chatbot in bigger chatroom to entertain the participant
- Worst case scenario — Just used it internally for fun


## D.   PROJECT STRUCTURE

The following directory is our structure of our project:

"Currently Unavailable"


The dataset/ directory should contains the data described in the “Our meme chatbot dataset” section.



In the next two sections, we will train our chatbot.



## E   TRAINING THE COVID-19 FACE MASK DETECTION

We are preparing to train our chatbot using Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning(subjected to change).

*Results are to be expected in a few week time.



## F.  RESULT AND CONCLUSION

*Results and conclusion are to be expected in a few week time.

## G.   PROJECT PRESENTATION 

In this project, we learned how to create a chatbot using OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning(subjected to change).
